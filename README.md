# What do you call this in JavaScript?

This is a list of ambiguous symbols used in JavaScript that may be confusing to search for on the web.

## The list

| Symbol | Description    | Colloquial verbiage |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| `=>`   | Arrow function | "Hash rocket" |
| `===`   | Strict equality | "Equal" |
| `==`   | Loose equality | No one calls it anything. Don't use this. |
